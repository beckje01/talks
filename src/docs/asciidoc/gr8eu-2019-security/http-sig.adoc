== HTTP Signatures

A way to sign the content of a request, protects from tampering and replays. Also easy validate without many external calls.

=== Where have I seen that?

* https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md[Joyent]
* AWS API -- But not exactly
* Slack Calls -- But custom

== How Does It Work?

Creates a digest of things like the date and host headers that are signed. The public keys can be provided at a known URL and highly cached.

@startuml

  participant noti as "Notification Server"
  participant external as "External App"

  noti -> external: POST 1
  note left: Signed\nKey: 123

  external -> external: Validate Request
  activate external #lightblue
  


  external -> auth: Get Keys
  auth --> external
  note right: [\n{keyId:123, key:"adafd..."},\n ...\n]
  deactivate

  external --> noti:200 OK
  

  noti -> external: POST 2
  note left: Signed\nKey: 123
  
  activate external #lightblue
  external -> external: Validate Request
  deactivate
  
  external --> noti:200 OK


  noti -> external: POST 3
  note left: Signed\nKey: 123
  activate external #lightblue
  external -> external: Validate Request
  deactivate
  
  external --> noti:200 OK  

  noti -> external: POST 4
  note left: Signed\nKey: 123
  activate external #lightblue
  external -> external: Validate Request
  deactivate
  
  external --> noti:200 OK

== HTTP Signature Notes

* Only Sign Parts of the request that aren't transformed
** Exclude rate limit headers, forwarded for etc
* Expose a SET of Public Keys to allow rolling them
* Receiver of the call decides to check the signature
