Abstract

When building a modern IoT platform you will have security concerns that span from hardware all the way out to consumers phones. We will go through a deep dive of many security concepts and talk about pros/cons of each option while discussing how we have scaled our solutions.

The SmartThings cloud platform is a microservice architecture built out across many deployment methodologies in the cloud and we allow deep integrations from external developers. 

Some of the security tech we will cover while also talking about how to scale these practices: 
* HTTP Signatures
* JWT/JWS/JWE
* OAuth
** prefix routing
** metrics on number of uses for a tokens life cycle 

After we get through a foundation of these security approaches we will work through these scenarios with real world examples from my experience at SmartThings

* OAuth Provider
* OAuth Consumer

By the end I you will have a good understanding of when you could make use of these different security methods.

== Scaling Auth

What makes auth at scale hard?

* Centralized by Default
* High Cardinality for Everything
* Can't break legacy

== Tokens 

Overtime you may have multiple auth systems, different backends.

=== Token Type Detection

If you are supporting multiple token types such as JWT and opaque. You will want to handle them differently. 

* `1323.443.23` -- Looks like JWT because of the `.`
* `234-23-22` -- Looks like an opaque token with `-`

=== Prefixing Tokens 

We can support many data stores with prefixes allowing quick routing.

----
@startuml
  rectangle resource as "Resource Server"
  rectangle authEdge as "Auth Server"
  rectangle legacy as "Legacy Token Service"
  rectangle fresh as "Fresh Token Service"

  resource -[#blue,bold]-> authEdge: Check Token\n<b>leg:3234-234-2</b>
  authEdge -[#blue,bold]-> legacy: Check Token

  resource -[#green,bold]-> authEdge: Check Token\n<b>fresh:3234-234-2</b>
  authEdge -[#green,bold]-> fresh

=== Prefixing Tokens

We can extend to allow client side routing

[plantuml%interactive, _images/prefixclientRouting, svg, height=300, width=300]
----
@startuml
  rectangle resource as "Resource Server"
  rectangle authEdge as "Auth Server"
  rectangle legacy as "Legacy Token Service"
  rectangle fresh as "Fresh Token Service"

  resource -[#blue,bold]-> legacy: Check Token\n<b>leg:3234-234-2</b>

  resource -[#green,bold]-> fresh: Check Token\n<b>fresh:3234-234-2</b>

  authEdge -> fresh
  authEdge -up-> legacy

=== Token Exchange

If you expect all Î¼-services to check a forwarded token you pay the token check time every hop.

[plantuml%interactive, _images/lotsofchecks, svg, height=400, width=400]
----
@startuml
  rectangle client as "Client"
  rectangle edge as "API Edge"
  rectangle internal as "Location Service"
  rectangle internal2 as "Device Service"
  rectangle internal3 as "State System"
  rectangle auth as "Auth Server"

  client -[#blue,bold]down-> edge: Opaque\nToken
  edge -[#blue,bold]> internal
  internal -[#blue,bold]> internal2
  edge -[#blue,bold]-> internal3

  edge -up-> auth: Check
  internal -up-> auth: Check
  internal2 -up-> auth: Check
  internal3 -> auth: Check

=== Exchange for JWT

[plantuml%interactive, _images/jwtchecks, svg,height=300, width=300]
----
@startuml
  rectangle client as "Client"
  rectangle edge as "API Edge" #lightblue
  rectangle internal as "Location Service"
  rectangle internal2 as "Device Service"
  rectangle internal3 as "State System"
  rectangle auth as "Auth Server"

  client -[#blue,bold]> edge: Opaque\nToken
  edge -[#green,bold]down-> internal
  internal -[#green,bold]-> internal2
  edge -[#green,bold]right-> internal3

  edge -up-> auth: Check

== Operations 

The high cardinality of auth systems tend to make operating them very challenging at scale.

=== Allow/Deny Lists

* Ability to very early on in process to block bad actors
* Can load lists in bloom filters

=== Human Readable

* Add names to clients
* Quick Methods to Allow/Deny access based on easy identifiers

=== Other Tips

* Scope Aliasing 
* Logging Prefixes of Tokens


== Errors At Scale

Small blips can easily cause big issues.

=== Special Case Errors

If you are cascading calls make sure to agree on what an auth failure means. Instead of auth failure resulting in a 4XX default to a known 5XX.

=== Error Story

1. A datastore failed so we started returning a 500 from the auth server. 
1. App Servers treated an auth 500 as a 401
1. Mobile clients got 401s and triggered refreshing tokens
1. Mobile clients put more pressure on the already failing datastore
1. Go back to 1



=== Diligent Error Codes (401/403/5XX)

* *401* -- Means get a new token
* *403* -- Means don't do that again
* *5XX* -- Try again but coordinate jitter and back off
