Abstract
As the complexity of our systems grow so must our tooling, Zipkin is a great distributed tracing tool that helps deal with tracing in microservices. But once we have to tool in place how do we actually fix problems in our system? We have been using zipkin in production at SmartThings so Iâ€™m going to share our insights.

In this talk we will review how to get quickly get zipkin tracing added to Ratpack and Grails then actually go through debugging some issues. We will also cover strategies for interactions with mobile / external clients and how to figure out an amount to sample at.

No zipkin experience required.
