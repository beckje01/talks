# Talks

A collection of the raw talks in a shared repo.


## Checkout

This repo uses an old reveal.js submodule for the MD based decks; when cloning use the submodule update

```bash
git submodule update --init
```


## Gradle Build

The gradle build is for the asciidoc based decks. It is currently broken due to bintray going away and everything being very old. It needs an update.
